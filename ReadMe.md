# NairobiTours
This is a simple webpage that showcases Nairobi as a tourist destination, featuring three recommended activities to do in the city: safari tours, trying out the diverse local cuisine, and immersing oneself in the rich culture of the Masai people. 

The hero section provides an overview of what Nairobi has to offer, while the activities section showcases the three main attractions. 

Finally, the guide section introduces Abdirahman Abdiaziz, an avid adventurer who invites visitors to join him on a journey through Nairobi's unique landscape, food scene, and cultural heritage. 

The webpage uses HTML and CSS, and includes some basic styling elements to make the content more visually appealing.

# CSS used 

I have used concepts like:

CSS selectors: ID selectors (#hero, #callToAction, #activities, etc.)
CSS properties: background-color, background-image, background-size, text-shadow, color, padding, margin, border, border-radius, font-family, width, height, display, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, text-align, position, top, left, opacity, overflow, etc.
Pseudo-classes: :hover
Keyframes and animations: @keyframes, animation-name, animation-duration
CSS3 feature: scroll-behavior
CSS3 hiding scrollbar feature: ::-webkit-scrollbar
All of these CSS concepts are used to create the layout, styling, and interactivity of a website.
